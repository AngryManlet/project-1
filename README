This project was meant to explore the ways that hive allows for displaying data from an unstructured dataset. The data was interpreted to contain sales of each drink and the 
availability of said drinks in different branches. Multiple objects were created to be ran to display differing questions about the data, such as what drinks were sold the most in
a specific branch.
